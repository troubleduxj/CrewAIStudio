# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on completing the integration of Alembic for database migrations in the CrewAI Studio backend project. While Alembic is already partially initialized, it needs proper configuration to work with the existing SQLAlchemy models and database setup. This will enable version-controlled database schema changes and automated migration workflows for future development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want Alembic to be properly configured with the existing SQLAlchemy models, so that I can generate and apply database migrations automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Alembic environment is configured THEN it SHALL import and use the existing SQLAlchemy Base metadata from the models
2. WHEN the database connection is established THEN Alembic SHALL use the same database configuration as the main application
3. WHEN running alembic commands THEN they SHALL execute without configuration errors
4. WHEN the target_metadata is set THEN it SHALL include all existing model definitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to generate an initial migration that captures the current database schema, so that I have a baseline for future schema changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the initial migration THEN it SHALL include all existing tables (crews, agents, tasks, workflows, executions)
2. WHEN the initial migration is created THEN it SHALL include all columns, indexes, and constraints from the current models
3. WHEN the migration is applied to an empty database THEN it SHALL create the complete schema matching the current models
4. WHEN the migration file is generated THEN it SHALL have a descriptive name indicating it's the initial schema

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want Alembic to use the same database connection settings as the main application, so that migrations are applied to the correct database environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Alembic runs THEN it SHALL read database configuration from the same source as the main application
2. WHEN different environments are used (development, production) THEN Alembic SHALL connect to the appropriate database
3. WHEN database credentials change THEN Alembic SHALL automatically use the updated credentials without code changes
4. WHEN the database URL is configured THEN it SHALL support both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want a streamlined workflow for generating and applying migrations, so that I can efficiently manage database schema changes during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I modify a SQLAlchemy model THEN I SHALL be able to generate a migration with a single command
2. WHEN a migration is generated THEN it SHALL automatically detect model changes and create appropriate DDL statements
3. WHEN applying migrations THEN the system SHALL track which migrations have been applied
4. WHEN rolling back migrations THEN the system SHALL support downgrade operations
5. WHEN multiple developers work on the project THEN migration conflicts SHALL be minimized through proper versioning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want proper error handling and logging for migration operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with context
2. WHEN migrations are applied THEN the system SHALL log the operations being performed
3. WHEN database connection issues occur THEN Alembic SHALL provide helpful diagnostic information
4. WHEN migration conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL guide the developer on resolution steps
